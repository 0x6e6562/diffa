# Version 1.4 Change Log (2012-03-29)

## Release Overview

In order to upgrade to Oracle 11.2.0.2.0, support for versions 0 to 21 of the automated DB patching process have been sunset.
This means that Diffa will not automatically upgrade itself in place from a pre-1.4 release - this will have to be migrated manually.

## General Maintenance

* [77] - Collapsed database migrations down into a single version

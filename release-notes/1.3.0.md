# Version 1.3.0 Change Log (2012-03-08)

## Release Overview

The focus of this release is to provide support for MySQL (5.5.20+) and Oracle DBMS (11R2+).
It also contains some improvements to the general agent maintenance, consistency improvements to the API as well as some bug fixes.

## New Features

* [41] - Introduce a status page at /status to allow easy monitoring of agent status
* [45] - Return a 404 response when a superuser attempts to access resources under non-existent domains
* [53] - Disable all diagnostic explanations by default, but support enabling explanation limits configured by pair and domain.

## General Maintenance

* [54] - Corrected a behavior whereby when a correlation that previous had upstream and downstream elements has one of the elements removed, the correlation would get (incorrectly) marked as matched.

## Upgrading

Please note that the structure of the REST API has been revised to make it more consistent.
This will break any clients of the REST API that are using a pre-1.3.0 agent.

* [40] - Domain-scope API endpoints are now prefixed with "/domains", e.g., /diffa becomes /domains/diffa
* [42] - The /rest prefix has been removed, e.g. /rest/domains/abc becomes /domains/abc.

## Library Upgrades

* Upgraded to akka 1.3.1
* Upgraded to slf4j 1.6.4
* Upgraded to Logback 1.0.0

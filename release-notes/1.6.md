# Version 1.6 Change Log (2012-09-24)

## Release Overview

In this release, domains are replaced by spaces, which can be defined hierarchically.
Fine grained permissions can be applied to control access to spaces. In addition, roles
can be applied recursively, so that ACL schemes from parent spaces can be inherited
by child spaces.

## New Features

* [254] - Every entity is now keyed on spaces with a surrogate key.
* [255] - Introduce sub spaces.
* [258] - Implement fine grained privileges allowing for different user roles.
* [267] - Support for disabling validation of Entity ordering.

## General Maintenance

* [257] - Fixed unexpected overwriting of categories in Settings UI.
* [264] - Action proxy should look up path by id.
* [260] - Introduce extents as a way to asynchronously vacuum the DIFFS table.
* [266] - Fixed a caching bug in the space path lookup
* [268] - Fixed a special case bug in the space path lookup for the root space.
* [269] - Forward ported a fix for a memory leak from the 1.5.6 release tag.

## Library Upgrades

* Upgraded to JOOQ 2.5.1
* Upgraded to Hazelcast 2.3.1
* Upgraded to Lucene 3.6.1

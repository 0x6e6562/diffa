Diffa is a tool that manages real time differences between arbitrary components.

License
-------

Diffa uses the Apache license, Version 2.0.

Maven
-----

Diffa is maven built using Maven. Currently only version 2.2.1 has been tested.

Scala
-----

Diffa is written mostly in Scala. Due to Scala's class post-processing mechanism, we tend to find that the default Perm Gen settings get exhausted quite quickly.
So before you perform any of the Maven commands, please give the JVM a little more Perm Gen:

On Unix:

    export MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=512m

Or on Windows:

    set MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=512m

This is also documented in the README.maven_opts.txt file for an easy copy and paste.

Building
--------

Please do not overlook the previous note about perm gen. To build Diffa, just use the mvn install command from the root directory:

    $ mvn install

This will run the the test suite that comes with Diffa.

Booting The Agent
-----------------

The Diffa agent can be run using the Jetty plugin:

    $ cd agent
    $ mvn jetty:run

Booting The Demo Participants
-----------------------------

Diffa comes with a demo application that provides two fake participants. This can also be run using the Jetty plugin:

    $ cd participants-web
    $ mvn jetty:run

License Checking
----------------

Diffa uses the maven license plugin (http://code.google.com/p/maven-license-plugin/) to check that the license files are up to date.

To run the license check:

    $ mvn -e license:format -Dyear=2010

To reformat each file according to the header file:

    $ mvn -e license:format -Dyear=2010

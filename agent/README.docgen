The REST API documentation in markdown is auto-generated from annotations in the code. This is linked to the 'process-classes' phase.

The result should normally go to the 'doc/rest' subdirectory of a 'gh-pages' branch checkout.

You can specify the target directory by overriding the docs.targetDir property. Thus a full example would look as follows:

    cd DIFFA-MASTER-CHECKOUT/agent
    mvn install -Ddocs.targetDir=../../DIFFA-GH-PAGES-CHECKOUT/doc/rest

...assuming you have your checkouts of 'gh-pages' and 'master' in a common directory.

After checking the generated content you need to commit both the docgen logic/templates on the master branch and the generated files on the gh-pages branch separately.

Also see README in the root of the 'gh-pages' branch.
